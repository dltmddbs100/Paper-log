### Purpose

The purpose of paper-log is to list up papers to be read, and to record what I learn while reading each paper.

It covers various fields of ML, DL etc.

### Contents

+ This repository consists of **Reading, Organizing, Done** tab.

+ **Reading** refers to the paper I'm currently reading with interest, **Organizing** refers to the paper I'm organizing after reading, and **Done** refers to the paper I have read and organized.

+ To be specific, for all issues, **the title of the paper, abstract (original), main purpose, learnable content, and URL** are written.

+ Also, reviews of all papers I've read can be met in my [Tistory blog](https://deepkerry.tistory.com/category/Paper%20Review)
